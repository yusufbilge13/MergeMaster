# MergeMaster
Merge Master is a merging and hyper-casual game. The aim of the game is to get the highest score possible before the objects reach the upper limit. There are 10 objects of different sizes in total in the game. Objects of the same size can merge with each other. As these objects merge, the score increases and it is easier for the player to avoid the upper limit. There are 4 different themes in the game. These themes are Fruits, Planets, Balls and Billards. The player can change the theme as he wishes within the game.
